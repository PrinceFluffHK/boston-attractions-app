In this app, users can:
- add a historic site, specifying the name of the site, address, the year of establishment, a description, and a minimum age. They can also upload an image of the site.  If no image is uploaded, the site will show a default image. 
- view details about a site, including a list of reviews submitted by other users.
- add a review to a site, along with a rating. Users who are not signed in cannot add a review.
- up-vote and down-vote reviews. They can only up-vote or down-vote a review once.
- [WIP] delete reviews that they have made themselves
-- NOTE: reviews with votes cannot currently be deleted
